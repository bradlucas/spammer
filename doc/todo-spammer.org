* Things to do or consider

** feature/fix-mean-logic
*** DONE Running mean needs to be pre-processed so the next possible value isn't above the limit
*** DONE Same for the recent mean
*** DONE Refactor process-input to use ok-to-send
*** DONE Verify the running mean and recent mean functions are working properly

** Next...
*** DONE Add tests for simpler functions
*** Add tests for ok-to-send and process-input
*** Need a better new-mail function
- Need a ordered set
*** Command line to accept test file or number of test records to generate
*** Could use environ to pull 'max' values out of the enironment
*** What about a long running version. Suppose one that doesn't end?
**** Interruptable?
**** Support for interface to values while running
*** How about sending the email while processing?
